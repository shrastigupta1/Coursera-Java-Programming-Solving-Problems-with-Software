Perimeter Assignment: Part Two

Introduction:

In this assignment, we'll complete the PerimeterAssignmentRunner class to calculate various facts about shapes. The goals are as follows:

1a. Implement the method getLargestSide(Shape s): Returns the longest side in Shape s as a double.

1b. Update the method testPerimeter to call getLargestSide and print the result.

2a. Implement the method getLargestX(Shape s): Returns the largest x value among all points in Shape s as a double.

2b. Update the method testPerimeter to call getLargestX and print the result.

Discussion:

1. Complete getLargestSide method:
   - Iterate through each side of Shape s.
   - Calculate the length of each side.
   - Compare lengths to find the longest side.
   - Return the length of the longest side.

2. Output results of getLargestSide:
   - Call getLargestSide with the shape object.
   - Print the result.

3. Complete getLargestX method:
   - Iterate through each point in Shape s.
   - Compare x coordinates to find the largest x value.
   - Return the largest x value.

4. Output results of getLargestX:
   - Call getLargestX with the shape object.
   - Print the result.

Compile and run the program with example data files. Verify the output matches the expected results. Save our project files.
