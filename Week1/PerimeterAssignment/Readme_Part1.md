In this assignment, we'll complete the PerimeterAssignmentRunner class to calculate facts about shapes. The class is in the BlueJ project called PerimeterAssignmentRunner. Goals:

1a. Implement getNumPoints(Shape s): Returns the number of points in Shape s as an int.

1b. Update testPerimeter to call getNumPoints and print the result.

2a. Implement getAverageLength(Shape s): Returns the average length of all sides in Shape s as a double.

2b. Update testPerimeter to call getAverageLength and print the result.

Discussion:

1. Complete getNumPoints:
   - Declare an int counter.
   - Iterate over all points in the shape, incrementing the counter.
   - Return the counter.

2. Update testPerimeter to output getNumPoints result:
   - Call getNumPoints with the shape object.
   - Output the result.

3. Complete getAverageLength:
   - Calculate the perimeter and the number of points in the shape.
   - Divide the perimeter by the number of points to get the average length.
   - Return the result.

4. Update testPerimeter to output getAverageLength result:
   - Call getAverageLength with the shape object.
   - Output the result.

Compile and run the program with example data files. Verify the output matches the expected results. Save your project files.
