1. Create a method named `tester` that initializes a CSVParser from a FileResource and calls other methods with this parser.
   
2. Implement a method named `countryInfo(parser, country)` that returns information about a country based on the CSVParser and the country name. The information includes the country name, its exports, and export value.

3. Develop a void method named `listExportersTwoProducts(parser, exportItem1, exportItem2)` that prints the names of countries exporting both `exportItem1` and `exportItem2`.

4. Write a method named `numberOfExporters(parser, exportItem)` that returns the number of countries exporting a specific item.

5. Create a void method named `bigExporters(parser, amount)` that prints the names of countries and their export values for countries whose export value exceeds the specified amount.
