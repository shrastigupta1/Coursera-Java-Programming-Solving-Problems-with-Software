Part 1: Finding a Gene - Using the Simplified Algorithm
1. Create a new Java project named StringsFirstAssignments and a Class named Part1.
2. Write findSimpleGene to locate start and stop codons, returning the gene if conditions are met.
3. Implement testSimpleGene to test five DNA strings for gene presence.
Part 2: Finding a Gene - Using the Simplified Algorithm Reorganized
1. Create Part2 in StringsFirstAssignments, copy findSimpleGene and testSimpleGene.
2. Modify findSimpleGene with startCodon and stopCodon parameters, ensuring program compiles.
3. Adjust findSimpleGene to handle uppercase and lowercase DNA strings.
Part 3: Problem Solving with Strings
1. Create Part3 with methods twoOccurrences, testing, and lastPart.
2. twoOccurrences checks if stringa appears twice in stringb.
3. testing calls twoOccurrences on various string pairs and prints the result.
4. lastPart finds the part of stringb after the first occurrence of stringa.
5. testing calls lastPart with string pairs and prints results.
Part 4: Finding Web Links
1. Create Part4 to read a URLResource, identify YouTube links, and print them.
2. Check each word for "youtube.com", finding URLs using double quotes.
3. Use lastIndexOf to find the opening quotation mark backward from "youtube.com".
4. Convert strings to lowercase to handle case sensitivity for easier detection.
