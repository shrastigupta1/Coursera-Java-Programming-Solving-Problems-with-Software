Part 1: Finding Genes

Create a Java project named StringsSecondAssignments.
Create a Java Class named Part1 with the following methods:
Method findStopCodon(String dna, int startIndex, String stopCodon) - Returns index of first occurrence of stopCodon after startIndex, else returns length of dna strand.
Method testFindStopCodon() - Calls findStopCodon with examples and prints results.
Method findGene(String dna) - Finds gene in dna using "ATG" as start codon and any of the three stop codons. Returns gene formed by closest stop codon, else returns empty string.
Method testFindGene() - Creates five DNA strings, prints each string and its gene if found.
Method printAllGenes(String dna) - Repeatedly finds genes in dna and prints each until no more genes found.

Part 2: HowMany - Finding Multiple Occurrences

Create a Java Class named Part2.
Method howMany(String stringa, String stringb) - Returns count of non-overlapping occurrences of stringa in stringb.
Method testHowMany() - Calls howMany with various examples and prints results.

Part 3: How Many Genes?

Create a Java Class named Part3.
Copy findGene and printAllGenes methods from Part1.
Method countGenes(String dna) - Counts number of genes in dna.

Method testCountGenes() - Calls countGenes with different DNA examples and prints results for each.
